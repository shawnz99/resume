### Hello, world! I'm Nicolas Barrios 👋

---

I'm a 4th year Computer Science BS/MS Student, who's interested in DevOps, HPC, and distributed computing. I love all things optimizations, whether it be developer tools or playing nice with the compiler, as well as Free & Open Source software.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on developing a novel, hardware-accelerated render platform at [Bolt Graphics, Inc.](https://www.bolt.graphics/about).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust via a toy raytracer based on the [Raytracing in One Weekend book series](https://raytracing.github.io/) over at [nbarrios1337/lustre-rs](https://github.com/nbarrios1337/lustre-rs)
